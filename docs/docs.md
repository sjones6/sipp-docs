title: Sipp - A TypeScript MVC Framework
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

Sipp's goal is to help you develop applications quickly and maintain for the long term.

## Guiding Principles

1. Simplicity - if you can do it with less, don't do it with more.
2. Don't reinvent the wheel - follow established patterns, build-on solid libraries
3. Types Everywhere - types from the views, to middleware, to controllers.
4. Productivity - value developer productivity over runtime optimizations

## Inspiration

Sipp is inspired by some of the great frameworks (both in the broader JS ecosystem and other languages):

* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
