Sipp does not have any complicated system requirements, and it should run just about anywhere that Node runs.

Sipp is only tested with Node 12 and greater, so prefer to use the current LTS and you should be ok.

## Requirements

Node 12 or greater

npm v6 or greater, or yarn

For local development, Sipp defaults to using Sqlite, which can be used just by pulling in the required packages and binaries in via `npm`. In production, you may wish to use another compatible database provider.
