## With the Starter Kit

The fastest way to get started is to clone the starter kit.

The start kit includes local authentication with passport, database migrations and seed examples, and a few views.

#### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjones6/sipp-starter.git your-site

cd your-site

# clear out the git history
rm -rf .git
git init
```

#### 2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm i
```

#### 3. **Fire it up!**

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` and see your Sipp site running.

#### From Scratch

Coming soon.
